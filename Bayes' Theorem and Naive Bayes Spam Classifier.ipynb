        "\n",
        "On the 9th November 1999, Sally Clark (August 1964 – 15 March 2007), then a solicitor and 35-year-old mother of one, was convicted of the murder of her first two children. Christopher, her first child, had died three years earlier, aged just under three months. His death had originally been treated as arising by natural causes, probably “Sudden Infant Death Syndrome” (or “SIDS”). Her second child, Harry, died just over a year later at the age of two months. His death was treated as suspicious by the Home Office pathologist who carried out the post mortem. He then revisited Christopher’s death and determined that that too was suspicious. Sally Clark was arrested some weeks later and eventually tried at Chester Crown Court. The prosecution case relied on flawed statistical evidence presented by paediatrician Professor Sir Roy Meadow, who testified that the chance of two children from an affluent family suffering SIDS was 1 in 73 million. He had arrived at this figure by squaring his estimate of a chance of 1 in 8500 of an individual SIDS death in similar circumstances. The Royal Statistical Society later issued a statement arguing that there was no statistical basis for Meadow's claim, and expressed concern at the \"misuse of statistics in the courts\".\n",
